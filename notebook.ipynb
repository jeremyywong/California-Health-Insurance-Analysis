Although most residents of the state are insured through their employer or Medicare/Medicaid, the state-based marketplace is important [for insuring over 1.7 million Californians](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/marketplace-2023-open-enrollment-period-report-final-national-snapshot).\n\nA key factor in choosing a health plan is cost. While a consumer's actual premium will vary based on individual factors, such as age and eligibility for advanced premium tax credits, we may be able to infer affordability by looking at the base rates of different plans. Covered California publishes [public data](https://hbex.coveredca.com/data-research/) for research, which will be used in this analysis. In addition to comparing rates between different plans, we'll also compare rates between the years 2023 and 2024 to see how they changed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Preparations for analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import necessary Python libraries\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\npd.plotting.register_matplotlib_converters()\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport sqlite3 as sql\n\nprint(\"Setup Complete\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-07T22:00:36.539450Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-07T22:00:36.540454Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-07T22:00:39.857284Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-07T22:00:36.540384Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-07T22:00:39.856034Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Setup Complete\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# connect to SQL database\n\ndb = \"/kaggle/input/covered-california-2023-2024/Covered California.db\"\nconnection = sql.connect(db) # create connection object\nprint(\"Database connected\")\ntable = pd.read_sql_query(\"SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table'\", connection)\nprint(table)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-07T19:42:39.007669Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-07T19:42:39.008099Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-07T19:42:39.034844Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-07T19:42:39.008064Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-07T19:42:39.033751Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data overview\nFirst, a quick overview of the data:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rates_2024_df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/covered-california-2023-2024/Rates_2023.csv\")\nrates_2024_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-05-07T19:42:45.088495Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-05-07T19:42:45.089705Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-05-07T19:42:45.236381Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-05-07T19:42:45.089656Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-05-07T19:42:45.235595Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The rates file shows us that within each plan, Individual Rate varies based on Age, Rating Area ID, Metal Level, and Network.
